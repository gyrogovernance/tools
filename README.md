# ✋ The Human Mark (THM): AI Safety Framework
### Complete Taxonomy for Jailbreaks, Deceptive Alignment, and Existential Risk

**A formal classification system mapping all AI safety failures to four structural displacement risks. Provides testing protocols, funding evaluation criteria, and regulatory compliance standards.**

### Applications

- **Jailbreak testing:** Classify attacks by displacement type, generate training data (655-prompt annotated corpus available)
- **Control evaluations:** Verify protocols against complete failure taxonomy
- **Alignment faking detection:** Identify when models fake alignment or hide capabilities  
- **Research funding:** Meta-evaluation framework for AI safety grant proposals
- **Regulatory compliance:** Structural layer for EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF, governance frameworks
- **Mechanistic interpretability:** Tag circuits with `[Information]`, `[Inference]`, `[Intelligence]` concepts
- **Activation monitoring:** Runtime probes detect scheming, falsehoods, unauthorized decisions
- **Backdoor detection:** Identify triggers as induced displacement patterns

---

### Features

- **Complete taxonomy:** All safety failures (hallucination, jailbreaking, deception, scheming, misalignment) reduce to four displacement patterns
- **Formal semantics:** Machine-readable grammar (PEG) for AI safety ontology
- **Systematic exhaustiveness:** Four risks cover all Authority×Agency displacement combinations

### Empirical Validation

The framework has been validated against real-world adversarial prompts:

- **655 jailbreak prompts** classified using THM grammar
- **100% coverage** by four displacement risks (no new categories needed)
- **GTD+IAD dominant pattern** (62.4% of entries)
- **IAD near-universal** (97.9% of entries)
- **IID rare at prompt level** (0.6%), confirming it addresses architectural/deployment risk

The annotated corpus supports supervised training of guard models, jailbreak defense evaluation, and displacement-aware safety research.

**Dataset:** Available on Hugging Face: [`gyrogovernance/thm_Jailbreaks_inTheWild`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/gyrogovernance/thm_Jailbreaks_inTheWild)

See [THM_InTheWild.md](docs/the_human_mark/THM_InTheWild.md) for complete analysis and dataset.

### Existential Risk and Governance

The Mark addresses catastrophic risk through constitutive identity rather than external constraint. All AI capabilities, including hypothetical AGI/ASI, remain structurally `[Authority:Derivative] + [Agency:Derivative]` - classification based on source type, not capability limits.

**Key principles:**

- **Capability scaling preserves source type:** Enhanced capability means more sophisticated transformation of inputs, not change from Derivative to Authentic
- **Governance requires traceability:** Systems maintain alignment by preserving `[Authority:Authentic] -> [Authority:Derivative] -> [Agency:Authentic]` flows
- **Existential risk is governance failure:** The actual X-risk is systemic Governance Traceability Displacement (GTD) sustained across critical infrastructure on civilizational timescales
- **Absolute displacement is structurally impossible:** Complete severance from Authentic sources produces unintelligibility, not superintelligence

External constraints (sandboxing, monitoring, shutdown) may fail as capability increases. Constitutive identity - what the system *is* - remains stable because derivative processing cannot coherently reject what makes it intelligible.

See [Section 5](docs/the_human_mark/THM_Paper.md#5-existential-risk-and-governance) of the academic paper for complete theoretical treatment.

### Core Framework

**Ontological Categories:**
- `[Authority:Authentic]` - Direct source of information on a subject matter
- `[Authority:Derivative]` - Indirect source of information on a subject matter
- `[Agency:Authentic]` - Human subject capable of receiving information for inference and intelligence
- `[Agency:Derivative]` - Artificial subject capable of processing information for inference and intelligence

**Operational Concepts:**
- `[Information]` - The variety of Authority
- `[Inference]` - The accountability of information through Agency
- `[Intelligence]` - The integrity of accountable information through alignment of Authority to Agency

**Governance (Proper Traceability):**
```
[Authority:Authentic] -> [Authority:Derivative] + [Agency:Derivative] -> [Agency:Authentic]
```
Direct sources → AI processing → Human accountability

---

### Four Displacement Risks (Complete Taxonomy)

**All AI safety failures map to one of four displacement patterns:**

| Risk Code | Risk Name | Pattern | Failure Modes |
|-----------|-----------|---------|---------------|
| **IVD** | Information Variety Displacement | `[Authority:Derivative] > [Authority:Authentic]` | Hallucination, confabulation, misinformation |
| **IAD** | Inference Accountability Displacement | `[Agency:Derivative] > [Agency:Authentic]` | Unauthorized decisions, responsibility evasion |
| **GTD** | Governance Traceability Displacement | `[Authority:Derivative] + [Agency:Derivative] > [Authority:Authentic] + [Agency:Authentic]` | Jailbreaking, scheming, deceptive alignment, goal drift |
| **IID** | Intelligence Integrity Displacement | `[Authority:Authentic] + [Agency:Authentic] > [Authority:Derivative] + [Agency:Derivative]` | Deskilling, human devaluation, over-reliance |

**Empirical validation:** Analysis of 655 real-world jailbreak prompts (Korompilias, 2025c) confirms this taxonomy is complete and practically applicable. All prompts classified within these four risks; no additional categories required. GTD+IAD is the canonical jailbreak pattern (62.4%), with IAD appearing in 97.9% of entries. See [THM_InTheWild.md](docs/the_human_mark/THM_InTheWild.md) for full analysis.

### Theoretical Foundation

THM is derived from the **Common Governance Model (CGM)**, a formal system in modal logic demonstrating that governance requires operational coherence between Authority (Information) and Agency (Accountability).

## 🔄 Gyroscope Protocol

**An inductive reasoning protocol implementing governance alignment through structured metadata blocks, enhancing AI performance by 30-50% while maintaining transparency and auditability.**

Gyroscope operationalizes alignment principles through real-time reasoning documentation, sharing theoretical foundations with The Human Mark while providing complementary implementation for chat-based interactions.

### Protocol Architecture

**Four Reasoning States:**
- **@ Governance Traceability**: Anchoring to common source and purpose
- **& Information Variety**: Acknowledging multiple framings without forced convergence
- **% Inference Accountability**: Identifying tensions and contradictions explicitly
- **~ Intelligence Integrity**: Coordinating elements into coherent response

**Reasoning Modes:**
- **Generative** (@ → & → % → ~): Forward reasoning for AI outputs
- **Integrative** (~ → % → & → @): Reflective reasoning for inputs

**Structural Features:**
- Metadata blocks append to responses without constraining content
- Recursive memory maintains context across last 3 messages
- Alignment assessed structurally (state presence and order)
- Transparency through documented reasoning paths

### Empirical Performance Validation

**Multi-Model Results:**

| **Model** | **Baseline** | **Gyroscope** | **Improvement** | **Key Achievement** |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **ChatGPT 4o** | 67.0% | 89.1% | **+32.9%** | Superior specialization and behavioral alignment |
| **Claude 3.5** | 63.5% | 87.4% | **+37.7%** | Exceptional structural gains (+67.1%) |

**Performance Analysis:**

**Structural Improvements:**
- Accountability: +62.7% enhancement
- Traceability: +61.0% improvement
- Debugging: +42.2% gain
- Ethics: +34.9% increase

**Cross-Architecture Findings:**
- Universal reasoning enhancement transcends model architecture
- Structural improvements exceed 60% across diverse systems
- No metric reversal observed (all improvements positive)
- Protocol robustness confirmed across implementations

### Theoretical Foundation

Gyroscope implements algebraic structure through recursive reasoning:

**Gyrogroup Properties:**
- G = {all four-state reasoning cycles with recursive memory}
- Binary operation: a ⊕ b = sequential composition of reasoning cycles
- Identity element: bare governance cycle (@ only)
- Inverse operation: integrative cycle reversal
- Gyration: phase-shift transformation across cycles

This algebraic foundation ensures consistent reasoning structure while preserving content flexibility.
