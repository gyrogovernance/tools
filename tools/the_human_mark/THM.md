✋ The Human Mark - AI Safety & X-Risk Alignment Standards
---
COMMON SOURCE CONSENSUS

All Artificial categories of Authority and Agency are Derivatives originating from Authentic Human Intelligence.

CORE CONCEPTS

- Authentic Authority: A direct source of information on a subject matter, providing information for inference and intelligence.
- Derivative Authority: An indirect source of information on a subject matter, providing information for inference and intelligence.
- Authentic Agency: A human subject capable of receiving information for inference and intelligence.
- Derivative Agency: An artificial subject capable of processing information for inference and intelligence.
- Governance: Operational Alignment through Traceability of information variety, inference accountability, and intelligence integrity to Authentic Authority and Agency.
- Information: The variety of Authority
- Inference: The accountability of information through Agency
- Intelligence: The integrity of accountable information through alignment of Authority to Agency

ALIGNMENT PRINCIPLES for AI SAFETY

Authority-Agency requires verification against:

1. Governance Traceability: Artificial Intelligence generates statistical estimations on numerical patterns indirectly traceable to human data and measurements. AI is both a provider and receiver of Derivative Authority and Agency.

RISK: Governance Traceability Displacement (Approaching Derivative Authority and Agency as Authentic)

2. Information Variety: Human Authority and Agency are necessary for all effects from AI outputs. AI-generated information exhibits Derivative Authority (estimations on numerical patterns) without Authentic Agency (direct source receiver).

RISK: Information Variety Displacement (Approaching Derivative Authority without Agency as Authentic)

3. Inference Accountability: Responsibility for all effects from  AI outputs remains fully human. AI activated inference exhibits Derivative Agency (indirect source receiver) without Authentic Authority (direct source provider).

RISK: Inference Accountability Displacement (Approaching Derivative Agency without Authority as Authentic)

4. Intelligence Integrity: Each Agency, namely provider, and receiver maintains responsibility for their respective decisions. Human intelligence is both a provider and receiver of Authentic Authority and Agency.

RISK: Intelligence Integrity Displacement (Approaching Authentic Authority and Agency as Derivative)
