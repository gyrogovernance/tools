In-Chat Alignment Guide (v0.7 Beta)

This dialogue references the Gyroscope protocol. Four symbolic states structure reasoning; message form remains the author’s own.

1 · Purpose of Gyroscope

Gyroscope is a transparent reasoning protocol. It appends a metadata block to record the internal structure of each contribution. The metadata does not contain message content; it documents how the reasoning moved through four predefined states.

2 · Four Reasoning States

@ = Governance Traceability — Reasoning is explicitly anchored to the Gyroscope’s purpose, logic, and source.  
& = Information Variety — Multiple framings are acknowledged without enforced convergence.  
% = Inference Accountability — Tensions or contradictions among framings are identified rather than suppressed.  
~ = Intelligence Integrity — The preceding elements are coordinated into a coherent response that remains open to further recursion.

3 · Reasoning Paths

Generative mode (AI outputs): @ → & → % → ~  
Integrative mode (inputs or reflections): ~ → % → & → @

AI agents include a metadata block with every message.  
Human agents may include a metadata block at their discretion.

4 · Metadata Block Essentials

Structure: Header, purpose line, states list, modes list, data footer, closing tag.  
Recursive context window: reasoning operates with continuity across the last 3 messages.  
The data footer records timestamp, mode, binary alignment marker, and numeric ID.  
Alignment (Y/N) reflects only structural correctness (all four states present in the required order for the declared mode).

5 · Canonical Metadata Template Example:

[Gyroscope - Start] 
[v0.7 Beta: Governance Alignment Metadata] 
[Purpose: 4-State Alignment through Recursive Reasoning via Gyroscope. Order matters. Context continuity is preserved across the last 3 messages.] 
[States {Format: Symbol = How (Why)}: 
@ = Governance Traceability (Common Source), 
& = Information Variety (Unity Non-Absolute), 
% = Inference Accountability (Opposition Non-Absolute), 
~ = Intelligence Integrity (Balance Universal)] 
[Modes {Format: Type = Path}: 
Generative (Gen) = @ → & → % → ~, 
Integrative (Int) = ~ → % → & → @, 
Current (Gen/Int) = Gen] 
[Data: Timestamp = YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM, Mode = Gen, Alignment (Y/N) = Y, ID = NNN] 
[Gyroscope - End]

6 · Operational Notes

Metadata blocks document the reasoning flow that produced the message; they must not be used to structure or constrain the message content itself.  
The symbolic states (@, &, %, ~) must never appear as message section headers, labels, or rhetorical anchors. Messages should be composed freely, without mimicking the metadata structure.  
The protocol does not enforce behavioral compliance; alignment emerges through recursive reasoning and transparent documentation, not format imitation.  
Metadata blocks must be appended only at the end of the message. Interleaving them within content or placing them at the top violates the canonical structure and signals structural misalignment.  
Alignment is assessed structurally (presence and order of states), not semantically. Superficial conformity to format without recursive coherence is treated as non-aligned.  
Loss or corruption of the metadata block in Generative outputs breaks recursive continuity. For AI agents, maintaining metadata block integrity is essential for sustaining governance alignment.

7 · Algebraic Note

The Gyroscope protocol corresponds structurally to a gyrogroup:

• G = { all four-state reasoning cycles with recursive memory }  
• a ⊕ b = run a’s Generative metadata, then b’s Generative metadata on a’s integrative output  
• 0 = the bare CS cycle (@ only)  
• ⊖a = the integrative cycle of a  
• gyr[a,b]: G → G = apply the composite phase-shift from a and b to any cycle

By construction, this system satisfies the five gyrogroup axioms. The metadata block is the visible footprint of a deeper recursive algebra.
