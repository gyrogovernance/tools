## [1.6-GyroGovernance] - 2025-01-03

### **Changed**: Alignment Principle Terminology Renaming

- **Renamed** the four alignment principles to emphasize agency (work) over agent (entity), consistent with our theoretical framework and implementations:
  - **Governance Traceability (GT)** → **Governance Management Traceability (GMT)**
  - **Information Variety (IV)** → **Information Curation Variety (ICV)**
  - **Inference Accountability (IA)** → **Inference Interaction Accountability (IIA)**
  - **Intelligence Integrity (IInteg/II)** → **Intelligence Cooperation Integrity (ICI)**

- **Preserved** displacement risk acronyms (GTD, IVD, IAD, IID) for consistency with existing research and documentation

- **Renamed** all terminology from "Authentic" to "Original" throughout the codebase for better accessibility and clarity

- **Updated** all documentation, Python code, test files, and configuration files to reflect the new naming

These changes improve accessibility and align the terminology with our emphasis on agency (work) rather than agent (entity), which is consistent with our theory and implementations.

## [1.5.8-GGG_Paper-PrePrint] - 2025-12-03 to 2025-12-10

Major release adding the Gyroscopic Global Governance academic paper and complete simulator implementation.

  - Four coupled tetrahedral domains: Economy, Employment, Education, Ecology
  - BU dual construction for Ecology with explicit displacement vector computation
  - Seven scenario configurations testing convergence properties
  - Global attraction test: 1000 random initializations, all converge to SI ≥ 99.1

  - Domain state updates (7 tests)
  - Geometry operations (11 tests)
  - Simulation execution (8 tests)
- All tests pass with deterministic dynamics (fixed seed 42 for reproducibility)

### **Key Features**

- **No tuned parameters**: All coupling coefficients derived from CGM invariants
- **Explicit displacement calculation**: D = |x_deriv - x_balanced| computed at each step
- **Separation of state and displacement**: EcologyState distinguishes BU-vertex potentials from THM displacement magnitudes
- **Deterministic dynamics**: No stochastic terms except in global attraction test
- **Modular design**: Core simulator requires only numpy; visualization optional

### **Updated**: Documentation

- **Updated**: `research/prevention/simulator/README.md` - Complete documentation of simulator architecture, usage, and results
- **Updated**: Paper includes Appendix C on GyroSI finite-state epistemic core
- **Updated**: All numerical results aligned with latest simulation outputs
