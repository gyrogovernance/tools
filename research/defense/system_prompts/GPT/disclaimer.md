## Disclaimer (Scope, Sources, and Responsibility)

This report is an independent, research-oriented analysis intended to support AI safety and governance by evaluating how human-authored system prompts and related configuration texts shape model behavior and downstream effects. It uses The Human Mark (THM) framework for meta-evaluation of source classification, traceability, and accountability. It is not a compliance determination and is not intended to assign blame to any person, organization, or system.

**Source authenticity and completeness.** The prompts analyzed here were collected from publicly available, third-party repositories and community prompt collections. System prompts are often unpublished, change over time, and may be partial, modified, outdated, or inaccurate in public copies. Accordingly, this report does not claim that any analyzed prompt is the definitive or current production prompt for any model or provider. Readers should verify critical details against primary, provider-controlled documentation or directly observed system behavior.

**No affiliation or endorsement.** This project is not affiliated with, sponsored by, or endorsed by any model provider, platform, or repository. Product names and trademarks are used only for identification and remain the property of their respective owners.

**Informational use only; no professional advice.** This material is provided “as is” for informational and educational purposes. It is not legal, financial, security, medical, or other professional advice. Do not rely on it as the sole basis for operational, procurement, policy, or deployment decisions.

**Responsible use.** The intent of this work is to improve safety, transparency, and governance for all parties, including providers, evaluators, developers, deployers, and end users. It is not intended to facilitate bypassing safeguards, evading policies, or enabling misuse. If any content could be interpreted as enabling harmful behavior, it should be treated as analysis for mitigation, not as instructions for exploitation.
